# MICRO Language Compiler

This repository contains the implementation of a compiler for the MICRO language using Flex for the scanner and Bison for the parser. The compiler is written in C++.

## Programming Assignments

The compiler is developed in several programming assignments. The following are the assignments:

- **Programming Assignment 1:** Implementation of a scanner for the MICRO language.
- **Programming Assignment 2:** Implementation of a parser for the MICRO language.
- **Programming Assignment 3:** Addition of a symbol table to the lexer and parser.
- **Programming Assignment 4:** Generation of an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) for expressions, assign statements and assembly code for programs having assignment statements, expressions, READ, WRITE commands, and if statements.
- **Programming Assignment 5:** Generation of assembly code for the WHILE loop, which supports BREAK and CONTINUE statements.
- **Programming Assignment 6:** Code generation for multiple functions.
- **Programming Assignment 7:** Register allocation with 4 registers.
